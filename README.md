# 🚀 React Component Re-render Issue Explanation

This React component experiences **unnecessary re-renders** due to object reference changes in the dependency array of a `useEffect` hook. Here's a breakdown of the issue and how to fix it.

---

## ❌ Problem Analysis

### 1️⃣ Object Reference Change
Each render creates a new object:

```jsx
const person = { personAge: age, personName: name };
```

Even if `name` and `age` **don’t change**, a **new object reference** is created on every render.

### 2️⃣ `useEffect` Dependency Array

The effect runs on every render because React compares **object references, not content**:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('person rerender', person);
}, [person]); // ⚠️ New reference every render
```

### 3️⃣ Unrelated State Updates

A **dark mode toggle** triggers a re-render:

```jsx
onChange={() => setDarkmode(!darkmode)}
```

This causes **`person` to be recreated**, triggering `useEffect` **even if `name` and `age` are unchanged**.

---

## 🔄 Visualizing the Flow

```text
darkmode toggle → component re-render → new person object → useEffect sees changed dependency → effect runs
```

---

## ✅ Solution: Memoize the Object

Use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary object recreation:

```jsx
const person = useMemo(() => ({
  personAge: age,
  personName: name
}), [name, age]); // ✅ Only recreates when name/age change
```

### 🎯 Benefits:
- **Preserves object reference** between renders
- **Prevents unnecessary `useEffect` executions**
- **Improves performance**

---

This small optimization ensures that the effect **only runs when necessary**, avoiding unnecessary computations and improving React app efficiency! 🚀
